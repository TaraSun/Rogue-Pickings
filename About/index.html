          <p>Rogue Pickings started out as a dream and a skillet. Melissa Rogue discovered her love for cooking in college, initially born out of necessity. “I’ve always loved good food, but I never really appreciated the art of it until I dove into it.” says Melissa. All the while studying accounting in school, she dreamed of one day owning a restaurant.</p>
          <p>After turning vegan, her dishes took the shape of what you see on the menu today. “When meat isn’t the main attraction of the dish, it really opens up the option to be creative on what flavors come through and the potential pairings.”</p>
          <p>After working as an accountant for several years, Melissa and her husband, Chase, decided to take the plunge and purchase a food truck. They fixed it up and curated their menu. Chase is a nutritionist and together they created recipes that are wholesome, healthy, and delicious. They chose their name, Rogue Pickings, to reflect the care they take sourcing and selecting their ingredients.</p>

          <p>Initially, they only took the food truck to local events and festivals, while still maintaining their day jobs; however, their popularity skyrocketed. Melissa took a chance and quit her stable accounting job to run the food truck full time. The food truck was swamped with hungry fans daily from the nearby hospital and business park. However, patrons also included those who drove from their offices 20 minutes away. With encouragement from these regulars, Melissa eventually purchased two more food trucks to be stationed in nearby neighborhoods. </p>
          <p>Melissa and her team can’t wait to meet you and serve you up a smile. Our menu changes daily, including seasonal specials. Check out where to find a truck nearest you! </p>
